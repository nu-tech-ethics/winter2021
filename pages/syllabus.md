## About the Course
### Why should we care about ethical questions with respect to technology?
Computing Technologies shape our personal, social, and political lives in increasingly complex and consequential ways -- providing tremendous benefits (e.g. convenient access to information, connecting to one another across time and space) and harms (e.g. biased decision-making, mass surveillance, disinformation campaigns, and exclusion from critical material opportunities) that are important to examine and understand. At the same time, these technologies are born and shaped by the societies in which they are developed. Thus, grappling with the ethics of technologies (i.e considering the harms and benefits, how and why they were created in the first place, and how and to what ends they are used) is important not only for ultimately creating more moral technologies but a more moral society. 

Thus, our approach to the ethics of computing technologies requires a multifaceted assessment of their harm and benefit to our individual, cultural, and political lives, and simultaneously a critical examination of the values, ideologies, and contexts through which computing technologies emerge. To accomplish this, we will engage in critical reading and synthesizing across a range of topics drawn from computer science and HCI, education and learning sciences, as well as ethics and philosophy, and conduct "under the hood" case studies of particular focal technologies through in-class labs and exercises. As a class we will strive towards the following specific goals:

### 1. Develop a conceptual framework for assessing the ethics of computational technologies, and apply framework to a range of contemporary contexts
Particularly in light of the ongoing twin pandemics of COVID-19 and systemic racism, we will wrestle with topics such as police surveillance and other law enforcement technologies, contact tracing, social media platforms, and the massive shift to online and hybrid modes of education. 

### 2. Take a historical perspective on current debates involving computing and society
Technologies have always shifted how societies organize and regulate resources, people, and the environment. Given this, we can gain some perspective on our own dilemmas by examining (similar) technological controversies of previous eras:
* How have technologies of the past — both material (e.g. the telescope, the printing press, the steam engine) and ideal (e.g. classification systems, laws, policies, institutions, economic systems) — worked together to usher in new ways of thinking and doing? How has this produced new winners and losers?
* Have computing technologies introduced fundamentally new ethical challenges? Extended existing ones? Both?

### 3. Carefully explore AI/ML and the Internet as particularly significant and revelatory cases through which to explore fundamental ethical questions with respect to computing technologies.
We will also examine the ethics, values, and principles of several “ubiquitous” computing applications, with a particular focus on applications of machine learning, AI, and the internet. We will do this through:
* ***Hands-on labs*** — to learn about how specific computing technologies work (particularly those problematized in the readings). This includes an examination of what these technologies / computational methods are capable of, and some of their potential vulnerabilities.
* ***Case studies*** — to examine how applications involving these technologies make particular choices and trade-offs that tend to distribute benefits and harms unevenly across different communities, institutions, and sectors of society.


### 4. Consider the role of public policy and education in mediating (i.e facilitating, exacerbating, transforming) fundamental ethical questions with respect to the design, use, and proliferation of emerging technologies 
Finally, we will examine how social, economic, and political priorities have shaped the development and direction of computing applications; and the role of policy, education, design choices, and other levers in influencing the ethics of emerging technologies. To do this, we will study and discuss existing trends, recommendations, and solutions offered by a variety of thinkers; and what these ideas might look like in practice.


## Coursework & Assignments
The course format will consist of:

{:.small}
| 1. Attendance, participation, & reading responses | **20%** |
| 2. Labs | **20%** |
| 3. Midterm Project | **30%** |
| 4. Final Project | **30%** |

### 1. Attendance, Participation, and Reading Responses (20%)
We will use classroom discussion as a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate the required [course readings](../readings). Your timely and engaged attendance at every class is thus very important – both for you and for your classmates. Every student will need to participate in a thoughtful and productive manner in order for these discussions to be effective. Building on and reacting to other participants’ comments is encouraged, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree. In order to participate fully, please do not let your laptop, phone, or other devices distract you or other participants. 

Additionally, we will begin selected classes with a short writing response based on that day’s readings. Your participation grade will be based on evidence that you have completed the readings and are able to thoughtfully respond to the day’s writing prompt. Unexcused absences and tardiness will affect this part of your grade. 

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> **Attendance and Absence Policy**
> 
> You are allowed two unexcused absences during the quarter, no questions asked. You should reserve these absences for the occasional emergency or illness. After two absences, your final grade will be lowered by one level for each absence. For example, if you had an “A” in the course, your grade will be lowered to an “A-.”

### Books
We will be reading *Race After Technology* by Ruja Benjamin (2019) in its entirety, as well as excerpts from the books listed below:

### 2. Technology Labs (20%)
The technology labs will provide a way to explore and better understand some of the underlying mechanisms of various computing technologies. In other words, in order to reason about the possibilities and risks that are inherent to certain classes of technologies, we believe it is useful to examine how these technologies work. These labs will not require any prior programming knowledge, but they will ask you to engage with technical ideas (basic statistics, how databases work, and so forth). When possible, we aim to use “real-world” datasets to ground these labs in real contexts and dilemmas.

### 3. Midterm Paper (30%)
See [midterm paper](../assignments/midterm-paper)

### 4. Final Project (30%)
The final project will likely be a speculative assignment (still being designed) that will ask you to consider how one or more computing technologies has shaped our world in the year 2100.


## Expectations
* You will come to class prepared and ready to engage in an intellectual discussion about the readings.
* You will complete all assignments on time and with interest, engagement, and intellectual curiosity.
* You will bring your unique expertise, perspectives, and experiences to class and share them with others, so that we might all gain from your perspectives.
* You will respect and seek to understand the unique perspectives and experiences of others.
* You will give your classmates the benefit of the doubt (about their competence and intentions) and can expect the same from them.
* All work that you submit will be your own original work; you will cite others’ work where appropriate. 

### Office Hours
Will will post our office hours schedule during the first week of classes.


## Course Learning Goals

{:.blockquote-no-margin.callout}
> ### Course Goals
> 1. [Recognizing the impact of one's own assumptions, biases, and experiences](#goal-1)
> 2. [Identifying (and questioning) dominant/normative ways of thinking about computing and technology](#goal-2)
> 3. [Understanding some of the underlying concepts that power AI and the internet](#goal-3)
> 4. [Developing a framework for thinking about the relationship between technology and society](#goal-4)
> 5. [Considering how to participate in a world that is heavily mediated by computing](#goal-5)

{:#goal-1}
### 1. Recognizing the impact of one's own assumptions, biases, and experiences
Students will appreciate and understand how their own assumptions, experiences, worldviews, social location, and identity categories can and do impact the design, implementation, and use of computing technologies. Our hope is that students across a range of majors will become more conscious, sensitive, ethically aware, and humble thinkers/doers in the world. 

{:#goal-2}
### 2. Identifying (and questioning) dominant/normative ways of thinking about computing and technology
Students will learn some techniques for recognizing social values in computer-mediated systems. This includes being able to identify how these systems can and do extend and challenge the power and reach of particular political and economic systems, cultural traditions, and societal norms -- for better or for worse.

{:#goal-3}
### 3. Understanding some of the underlying concepts that power AI and the Internet
Students will gain a high-level understanding of how a subset of computing technologies  function (e.g. page rank, third party data APIs, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, and others); and how each of these technologies can be both beneficial and harmful. Moreover, students will be able to explain these ideas to their friends and family.

{:#goal-4}
### 4. Developing a framework for thinking about the relationship between technology and society
Students will develop a framework for considering when, how, or even if technological solutions are appropriate in a given situation. There are many ways to solve problems and shape social outcomes (e.g. law, policy, institutional supports, technologies, educational initiatives, and so forth). As such, we hope that students will recognize and value many different forms of participation and action within sociotechnical systems, and think broadly and holistically about innovation and creative problem-solving.

{:#goal-5}
### 5. Considering how to participate in a world that is heavily mediated by computing
Lastly, students will formulate ideas (or strengthen existing ones) around how they might use their own knowledge, skills, dispositions, and creativity to participate in the world going forward; and to foster a more ethical and just society. This may involve taking some future action (big or small), exploring a new idea, reading more about a topic, or something else. 

## A Note on Class Recordings
We will **NOT** be recording classes. 

The Provost's office has asked instructors to publish the following language in the syllabus:
