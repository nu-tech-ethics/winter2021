> ## Learning During COVID-19
> The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and will present new, unexpected challenges to our class and to our community at Northwestern. I want to acknowledge that things are difficult for many of us on multiple fronts. Some thoughts:
1. Your health and well-being is always top priority. Please communicate with me if you have something going on so that we can figure out a path forward together.
2. There are numerous resources at Northwestern that are in place to support stuednts with extenuating circumstances (e.g. CAPS, talking to your academic advisor, talking to the dean of students, etc.). I can help you navigate these paths if you need help.


## About the Course
### Why should we care about ethical questions with respect to technology?
Computing technologies shape our personal, social, and political lives in increasingly complex and consequential ways – providing tremendous benefits (e.g. convenient access to information, connecting to one another across time and space) and harms (e.g. biased decision-making, mass surveillance, disinformation campaigns, and exclusion from critical material opportunities) that are important to examine and understand. 

At the same time, these technologies are born and shaped by the societies in which they are developed. Thus, grappling with the ethics of technologies (i.e considering the harms and benefits, how and why they were created in the first place, and how and to what ends they are used) is important not only for ultimately creating more moral technologies but a more moral society. Thus, our approach to the ethics of computing technologies requires a multifaceted assessment of their harm and benefit to our individual, cultural, and political lives, and simultaneously a critical examination of the values, ideologies, and contexts through which computing technologies emerge. 

To accomplish this, we will engage in critical reading and synthesizing across a range of topics drawn from computer science and HCI, education and learning sciences, as well as ethics and philosophy. We will also engage in hands-on activities to help us consider how technical decisions (e.g. sampling, data collection practices, categorization and classification, prediction, system design, etc.) involve human judgements that can have both intended and unintended consequences. Specifically, students will:

1. Examine the design choices and tradeoffs that various computing infrastructures make (and have made) in relation to important societal values (e.g. individual autonomy, free speech, equity, privacy, justice, security, access to opportunity, etc.).
2. Consider some of the intended and unintended consequences of computing applications within our communities, institutions, and social systems (e.g. schooling, employment, policing, transportation, business, etc.). This involves paying attention to who wins and who loses, as well as how these technologies might amplify existing marginalities and privileges.
3. Develop a variety of analytic lenses for examining computing technologies in terms of their social, ethical, and political consequences.

The course is open to all students. For CS majors and minors, the course aims to help students to consider and grapple with ethical dimensions of their work, in order to inform a more critical technical practice. For students pursuing non-computing disciplines, the course aims to provide a solid foundation for thinking about the possibilities, risks, and impacts of computer-mediated infrastructures on society.

## Course Format
The course format will consist of:
1. Readings and in-class discussions of current and enduring socio-technical dilemmas, and how they relate to applications of AI, Big Data, and the Internet.
2. Hands-on activities to help students to consider the potential impacts of different kinds of technical decisions (e.g. sampling, data collection practices, categorization and classification strategies, prediction, system design, etc.).
3. Reflective writing assignments that will ask you to analyze the social and ethical dimensions of contemporary technology debates.

## Course Readings
We will be reading *Race After Technology* by Ruja Benjamin (2019) in its entirety, as well as excerpts from the books listed below:

## Coursework & Assignments
The course format will consist of:

{:.small}
| 1. Attendance, participation, & reading responses | **20%** |
| 2. Labs | **20%** |
| 3. Midterm Project | **30%** |
| 4. Final Project | **30%** |

### 1. Attendance, Participation, and Reading Responses (20%)
We will use classroom discussion as a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate the required [course readings](../readings). Your timely and engaged attendance at every class is thus very important – both for you and for your classmates. Every student will need to participate in a thoughtful and productive manner in order for these discussions to be effective. Building on and reacting to other participants’ comments is encouraged, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree. In order to participate fully, please do not let your laptop, phone, or other devices distract you or other participants. 

Additionally, we will begin selected classes with a short writing response based on that day’s readings. Your participation grade will be based on evidence that you have completed the readings and are able to thoughtfully respond to the day’s writing prompt. Unexcused absences and tardiness will affect this part of your grade. 

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> **Attendance and Absence Policy**
> 
> You are allowed two unexcused absences during the quarter, no questions asked. You should reserve these absences for the occasional emergency or illness. After two absences, your final grade will be lowered by one level for each absence. For example, if you had an “A” in the course, your grade will be lowered to an “A-.”

### 2. Technology Labs (20%)
The technology labs will provide a way to explore and better understand some of the underlying mechanisms of various computing technologies. In other words, in order to reason about the possibilities and risks that are inherent to certain classes of technologies, we believe it is useful to examine how these technologies work. These labs will not require any prior programming knowledge, but they will ask you to engage with technical ideas (basic statistics, how databases work, and so forth). When possible, we aim to use “real-world” datasets to ground these labs in real contexts and dilemmas.

### 3. Midterm Paper (30%)
See [midterm paper](../assignments/midterm-paper)

### 4. Final Project (30%)
The final project will likely be a speculative assignment (still being designed) that will ask you to consider how one or more computing technologies has shaped our world in the year 2100.


## Expectations
* You will come to class prepared and ready to engage in an intellectual discussion about the readings.
* You will complete all assignments on time and with interest, engagement, and intellectual curiosity.
* You will bring your unique expertise, perspectives, and experiences to class and share them with others, so that we might all gain from your perspectives.
* You will respect and seek to understand the unique perspectives and experiences of others.
* You will give your classmates the benefit of the doubt (about their competence and intentions) and can expect the same from them.
* All work that you submit will be your own original work; you will cite others’ work where appropriate. 

### Office Hours
Will will post our office hours schedule during the first week of classes.


## Course Learning Goals

{:.blockquote-no-margin.callout}
> ### Course Goals
> 1. [Recognizing the impact of one's own assumptions, biases, and experiences](#goal-1)
> 2. [Identifying (and questioning) dominant/normative ways of thinking about computing and technology](#goal-2)
> 3. [Understanding some of the underlying concepts that power AI and the internet](#goal-3)
> 4. [Developing a framework for thinking about the relationship between technology and society](#goal-4)
> 5. [Considering how to participate in a world that is heavily mediated by computing](#goal-5)

{:#goal-1}
### 1. Recognizing the impact of one's own assumptions, biases, and experiences
Students will appreciate and understand how their own assumptions, experiences, worldviews, social location, and identity categories can and do impact the design, implementation, and use of computing technologies. Our hope is that students across a range of majors will become more conscious, sensitive, ethically aware, and humble thinkers/doers in the world. 

{:#goal-2}
### 2. Identifying (and questioning) dominant/normative ways of thinking about computing and technology
Students will learn some techniques for recognizing social values in computer-mediated systems. This includes being able to identify how these systems can and do extend and challenge the power and reach of particular political and economic systems, cultural traditions, and societal norms -- for better or for worse.

{:#goal-3}
### 3. Understanding some of the underlying concepts that power AI and the Internet
Students will gain a high-level understanding of how a subset of computing technologies  function (e.g. page rank, third party data APIs, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, and others); and how each of these technologies can be both beneficial and harmful. Moreover, students will be able to explain these ideas to their friends and family.

{:#goal-4}
### 4. Developing a framework for thinking about the relationship between technology and society
Students will develop a framework for considering when, how, or even if technological solutions are appropriate in a given situation. There are many ways to solve problems and shape social outcomes (e.g. law, policy, institutional supports, technologies, educational initiatives, and so forth). As such, we hope that students will recognize and value many different forms of participation and action within sociotechnical systems, and think broadly and holistically about innovation and creative problem-solving.

{:#goal-5}
### 5. Considering how to participate in a world that is heavily mediated by computing
Lastly, students will formulate ideas (or strengthen existing ones) around how they might use their own knowledge, skills, dispositions, and creativity to participate in the world going forward; and to foster a more ethical and just society. This may involve taking some future action (big or small), exploring a new idea, reading more about a topic, or something else. 

## A Note on Class Recordings
We will **NOT** be recording classes. 

The Provost's office has asked instructors to publish the following language in the syllabus:

> ### Policy On Unauthorized Student Recording of Classroom or other Academic Activities
> Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact AccessibleNU. Unauthorized use of classroom recordings — including distributing or posting them — is also prohibited.  
>
> Under the University’s Copyright Policy, faculty own the copyright to instructional materials — including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.  Students cannot copy, reproduce, display or distribute these materials. Students who engage in unauthorized recording, unauthorized use of a recording or unauthorized distribution of instructional materials will be referred to the appropriate University office for follow-up.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with AccessibleNU (847-467-5530) and provide professors with an accommodation notification from AccessibleNU, preferably within the first two weeks of class. All information will remain confidential.
