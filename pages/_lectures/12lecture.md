    - Is bias in AI different from other forms of bias? If so, how?
    - Consider the dimensions and scale of impact that bias in AI might have
    - Is bias in AI inevitable, or is it possible to take steps to mitigate it? What kinds of intervention do you think might help?
    - On a technical level, what is AI?
    - What are machine learning, data science, and "deep learning"?
