What’s new about categorization and classification? How do new data and computing technologies shape / disrupt / reify / reproduce existing categorization / classification systems?

### Guiding Questions
* How do computer- and data-mediated systems shape how classification and categorization impact our world?
* How do new computing infrastructures circumvent existing systems of accountability (i.e. of protected groups and categories for which decision ought not to be based)? 

## Readings
* Kitchin, R., & Lauriault, T. P. (2014). Towards critical data studies: Charting and unpacking data assemblages and their work. Geoweb and Big Data, 1–19. Retrieved from http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2474112 

### Contemporary Examples & Issues 
* Black Mirror, Season 3, Episode 1: NoseDive & commentary
* Chinese Social Credit System (Shazeeda Ahmed — guest speaker)?

## Activities
* Analysis of Black Mirror episode as a case of racialization
* Pick a categorization / classification system from one of the readings. 
    * What are the categories? 
    * How are people / things assigned to these categories? 
    * What kinds of advantages / disadvantages are ascribed to each category (past and present)?
    * How do these become naturalized?

Categorization and classification systems have been used since the beginning of civilization to organize, sort, and order people, nature, and things. However, while these systems are useful for reasoning about and making sense of the world, these technologies also imbue cultural values, which are easier to see when looking at a classification system from another culture. 

Consider the sample classification systems below. What do each of these systems reveal about the culture in which they were made?

## A "Certain Chinese Encyclopaedia"

{:.blockquote-no-margin.callout.quote}
> In a certain Chinese encyclopaedia it is written that "animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) suckling pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camel hair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies."

> In the wonderment of this taxonomy, the thing we apprehend in one great leap, the thing that, by means of the fable, is demonstrated as the exotic charm of another system of thought, is the limitation of our own, the stark impossibility of thinking that.

## The Dewey Decimal System
Consider how these numbers are allocated across the religions of the world:

One prevelant theme in the Benjamin book is the examination of how two technological systems — race and ubiquitous computing — come together to normalize forms of social stratification. As Benjamin argues, this social process has a long history, and is empowered by the practices of categorization, classification, and representation. By dividing human and non-human entities into categories, and using a litany of representations and stereotypes to imbue particular meanings and values into those categories, social heirarchies are established and maintained.

This is useful for reasoning about and making sense of the world. However many of these categories and designations (e.g. race, gender, disability, etc.) are problematic, reductive, and justify social and ecological harm.

designations work this way, “market segmentation” works the way, therefore ML/AI works this way,  we treat the natural world in this way, etc.
I think this topic might cover two weeks because there are so many important cases and ideas to explore here. 

### Guiding Questions
* What kinds of work do categorization, classification, and “regimes of legibility” do in the world?
* Name some “famous” classification systems and the kinds of systems / laws / policies these systems have authorized in the world.
* [other classifications that permeate society] gender, disability, sexuality, “gifted/remedial”
* Do computer- and data-mediated systems shift how classification and categorization impact our world? If so, in what ways?

#### In the News
* Race: George Floyd, anti-blackness, and a collective failure to re-mediate historically-produced structural violence
* What are the implications of being put into the category of “essential worker”?
* What policies have the classification “illegal” or “international” recently authorized/justified?
* Gender assignment (recent Chicago Lurie Hospital decision)


## Activities
* Discussion of the examples of classifications and their consequences from Benjamin, CH1-3, and understanding the process of racialization.
