One prevalent idea explored in ***Race After Technology*** is how two technological systems — race and ubiquitous computing — come together to normalize forms of social stratification. Today we will look at categorization and classification as both a psychological and social phenomenon, and consider how various technologies (economic systems, computing infrastructures, laws, etc.) work to both reify and challenge existing ways of categorizing and classifying people.
