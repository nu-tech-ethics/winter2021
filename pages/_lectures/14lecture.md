Today we are going to examine the evolution of the internet, both technically and ideologically. This includes tracing the development of internet (and web) infrastructure, examining some of the early promises of the web, and discussing whether these early hopes have been realized in our current historical moment.

### Guiding Questions
* What was the role of academia / the military in producing the internet?
* Did Al Gore invent the internet (and/or what is the actual significance of this statement)?
* What were some of the claims made about the potential of the internet in the early/mid 1990s?
* Who were some of the early public intellectuals of the web, and what were their politics? 
* In what ways have these understandings of the internet changed? 
* What are some of the ways in which individual and collective values are in tension with one another?
