Some questions for your consideration:

* How do media representation normalizes and/or resist how categories are assigned and/or what they mean? 
* How do computing infrastructures challenge / produce / reproduce ideas about people in terms of the categories to which they belong?
* What is new (velocity, size, scale, granularity, ubiquity, centralization, etc. of categories) about transmission of symbols, imagery, and ideas about people and things? What has always been with us (fake news, stereotypes, etc.)?
