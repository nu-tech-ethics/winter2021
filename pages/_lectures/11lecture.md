Ideas to cover: 
## Databases
* Why are they useful? 
* It used to be the case that...
   * Databases were only to organize information (a way to store, retrieve, archive, version, document, info). 
   * Ask questions of the data. Tax info, HR databases (hiring, etc.), recipients of public services, geodatabases of protected lands and habitats, genome databases, etc. Stores used them to track inventory.

## Databases & Ideology
There's a common trope of "from data -> information -> knowledge" but many scholars (including Benjamin) have critiqued this notion. A databases is theory of the world, given the things you need to / hope to do with empirical information that you’re collecting. As such, **people** decide which features are worth collecting based on the use cases. All data is constructed in a particular context with a particular goal in mind. And with those decisions come judgement calls, which are made by the creator:
* How you sample
* The features you collect
* The conclusions you draw

## What’s new in an era of big data? 
### Data Collection
* Pervasiveness and ubiquity of da: size, scale, and types (personal) of data that are being collected
* New opportunities for data collection
    * Third party cookies, clicking and browsing history, reading your email, platform trackers: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/smarter-living/how-to-see-what-the-internet-knows-about-you.html 
    * Sensors
    * Video cameras everywhere
    * Intercepting communication transmission; cellphone logs
* **Speed:** Databases are getting built and processed in real-time

### Replication and Aggregation
* Databases are being copied, replicated, and remixed over the internet.
* Disparate data sources being stitched together, bought and sold, reprocessed, etc.

### New Statistical and Computational Methods
New computational methods on a range of new data sources have powered many new types of applications:
    * Widespread use of statistics and data-driven algorithmic methods (ML) over user-generated data at an unprecedented size and a scale
    * From mostly descriptive to leveraging correlations to derive features, classify entities, and make predictions about behavior: ML / Data Science
