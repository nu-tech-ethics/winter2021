* How media representation normalizes categories. 
* How do networked computing infrastructures challenge / produce / reproduce winners and losers? 
* What is new (velocity, size, scale, granularity, ubiquity, centralization, etc. of categories) and what has always been with us (fake news, stereotypes, etc.)

### Guiding Questions
