On <a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/130544/discussion_topics/888667" target="_blank">Canvas</a>, please respond respond to any of the ideas introduced in this week's readings. As specified in the syllabus, shoot for around 200-400 words in length (give or take). Some approaches you might take:

* Summarizing one or more key arguments and whether / how these arguments resonate with you.
* Analyzing some of the strengths or weaknesses of the arguments made in the readings.
* Writing about an idea you were confused about and/or didn’t entirely understand (and what about them was confusing / ambiguous).
* Sharing thoughts about how the readings connect to other readings we’ve done, to current events going on in the world, or to an experience that you've had.
* Sharing thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail.
