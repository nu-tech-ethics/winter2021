1. In 2-3 sentences, describe the philosophical perspective and key moral commitments that you read about for today (either Utilitarianism, Libertarianism, or Kantian / Deontological Ethics)
2. Then answer *ONE* of the following questions:
   * What are your general reactions to this philosophical perspective? Feel free to discuss your thoughts on its merits, its limitations, or both.
   * Describe a time when the philosophical perspective you just selected was used to defend an idea or practice that you fundamentally disagree with.

When you're done, paste your response from the Google Doc into the <a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/130544/assignments/846197">Canvas Assignment</a>.
