## Analyze a computing application of your choice

Pick a technology or a system that you would like to think more about in terms of its broader social and ethical implications. Then, using at least 3 of the academic sources we have read so far, develop a conceptual framework that articulates your unique perspective on technology. Your conceptual framework should integrate theoretical arguments from the readings covered thus far and your own personal identity and experience in the world. Ultimately, your conceptual framework should be useful, and productive. You will draw upon it to conduct a sociopolitical analysis of your technology. 

Your analysis will be designed to shed light on questions such as: 

* What values do this technology reflect, embrace, reject, or encourage? 
* Who is affected by its design? 
* How was its design affected by society? 
* Who reaps the benefits, and who suffers the costs of its creation and use? 

Your paper should be 3-4 pages double spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman. Follow APA guidelines for formatting and references.
