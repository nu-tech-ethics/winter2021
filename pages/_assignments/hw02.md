## Analyze a technology of your choice

Pick a technology that you would like to think more about in terms of its broader social and ethical implications. You may interpret the concept of "technology" however you like. Then, using at least 3 of the academic sources we have read so far, analyze some of the social and political dimensions of the technology you selected. Your analysis should shed light on questions such as: 

* What values do this technology reflect, embrace, reject, or encourage? 
* Who is affected by its design?
* How was its design affected by society? 
* Who reaps the benefits, and who suffers the costs of its creation and use? 

Your paper should be 3-4 pages double spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman. Follow APA guidelines for formatting and references. 

In addition to yoru paper, please  create a very short, 3-slide summary of your analysis using Google Slides, PowerPoint, etc. Feel free to communicate these ideas any way that you want (text, images, etc.). You will be giving a short (3-5 minute presentation of your paper in class on Thursday, 2/25).
