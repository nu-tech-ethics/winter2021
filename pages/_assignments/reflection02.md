On <a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/130544/discussion_topics/883993" target="_blank">Canvas</a>, please respond to one of the following prompts:

## Option 1: Winner

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> "Artifacts donâ€™t have politics. People do."

How would Winner respond to this statement? Use a specific technological example from the reading to make your case.

## Option 2: Benjamin
Consider the following quote from Benjamin:

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> "...the desire for objectivity, efficiency, profitability, and progress fuels the pursuit of technical fixes across many different social arenas" (p. 7)

Given three of the values named above -- objectivity, efficiency, and progress -- pick one and define it in your own words. Then, think of an example of a technical fix was pursued in the name of **objectivity/efficiency/progress** (whichever value you chose) that ended up under/devaluing something else -- something that was perhaps even more important. Tell us about it.
